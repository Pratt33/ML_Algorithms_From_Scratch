# ML Algorithms From Scratch

Welcome to the **ML Algorithms From Scratch** repository! This project is dedicated to implementing various machine learning algorithms from scratch, without relying on high-level libraries like Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, or PyTorch. The goal is to gain a deeper understanding of how these algorithms work under the hood.

## Introduction

Machine learning libraries provide powerful tools for building models, but they often abstract away the underlying mechanics. This repository aims to demystify these algorithms by implementing them from scratch using Python and NumPy. Each implementation is accompanied by explanations, visualizations, and examples to help you understand the core concepts.

## Algorithms Implemented

Here are the machine learning algorithms currently implemented in this repository:

1. **Linear Regression**
2. **Gradient Descent Optimization**

Each algorithm is implemented in a separate Python file, with detailed comments and explanations.

## Installation

To use the code in this repository, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Pratt33/ML_Algorithms_From_Scratch.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the repository:
   ```bash
   cd ML_Algorithms_From_Scratch
   ```
3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

Each algorithm is implemented in a standalone Python file. You can run the scripts directly or import them into your own projects. Below is an example of how to use the Linear Regression implementation:

```python
from linear_regression import LinearRegression

# Sample data
X = [[1], [2], [3], [4], [5]]
y = [1, 3, 2, 3, 5]

# Initialize and train the model
model = LinearRegression()
model.fit(X, y)

# Make predictions
predictions = model.predict([[6]])
print(predictions)
```

For more examples and detailed explanations, refer to the individual algorithm files.
